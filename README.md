# Smart-Irrigation-System
This is a Arduino-based automated irrigation system integrated with MATLAB, using real-time weather data and crop-specific moisture thresholds to optimize water use. It Enhances crop health, promoting sustainability in agriculture.
The agricultural sector faces a formidable challenge marked by the inadequacies of traditional farming methods, particularly in irrigation, disease management, and pesticide application. Conventional irrigation practices often result in the inefficient use of water resources, either through excessive watering or insufficient hydration, both of which can compromise crop health and yield. Moreover, the lack of precise disease detection techniques and suboptimal pesticide application strategies further exacerbate these issues, leading to crop losses and environmental degradation. Recognizing the urgent need for innovative solutions, this project endeavors to revolutionize agricultural practices by harnessing the power of advanced technologies.
